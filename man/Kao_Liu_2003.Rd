\description{
Data of 24 university libraries in Taiwan with one input and five outputs.
}
\note{
There are three observations that are missing: expenditures of Library 24 and services of Library 22 and Library 23. Kao and Liu (2000b) represent the expenditures of Library 24 by the triangular fuzzy number Y=(0.11; 0.41; 1.0). The services of Library 22 and Library 23 are expressed by a same triangular fuzzy number Y=(0.41; 0.69; 1.0).
